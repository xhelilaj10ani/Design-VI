## Summary
In this lab, I explored the installation and use of GHDL and GTKWave, which are essential for simulating and analyzing digital circuits. GHDL functions as a compiler that translates VHDL code into machine-executable instructions, while GTKWave serves as a visualization tool to observe circuit behavior. VHDL itself is a hardware description language used to model and design digital systems. These tools play a crucial role in hardware development, enabling effective testing, verification, and documentation of digital circuits.
