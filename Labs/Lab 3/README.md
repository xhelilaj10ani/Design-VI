## python coordinates.py "Samuel C. Williams Library"
This command runs the Python script coordinates.py, which takes an address or landmark as input, uses the Geopy library to determine its geographical coordinates, and prints the full address along with its latitude and longitude.
![SCL](https://github.com/xhelilaj10ani/Design-VI/blob/main/Labs/Lab%203/SCL.png)

## python address.py "40.74480675, -74.02532861159351"
This command runs the Python script address.py, which takes geographical coordinates as input, uses the Geopy library to find the corresponding address, and prints the full address along with its latitude and longitude.
![add](https://github.com/xhelilaj10ani/Design-VI/blob/main/Labs/Lab%203/add.png)

## python cpu.py
This command runs the Python script cpu.py, which displays the number of physical and logical CPU cores and prints the CPU utilization percentages for each core every second for 10 seconds.

## Summary
By completing this lab, I learned how to execute Python commands through my terminal, improving my ability to run scripts and manage projects. I also gained hands-on experience with the jdcal, astral, and geopy packages. With jdcal, I worked with Julian dates, astral helped me calculate sun-related events, and geopy taught me how to find geographical coordinates and addresses.
